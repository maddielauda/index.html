<h1>The Dating App</h1>

<p>This is going to be a prototype using Axure RP for an all inclusive smart application to give those seeking a relationship a connection of any kind with individuals within a certain distance.</p>

<p>I chose this prototype because after reading some chapters of Technically Wrong,  I found that a lot of applications are narrow minded and non inclusive. For example, in Chapter 3 “Normal People”, Sara Wachter-Boettcher points out period apps that automatically assume the user's opinion on the matter and reason for use. Another interesting example is when applications, like Etsy, assume a certain person’s relationship status or sexual orientation. My goal for this project is to include multiple demographics and fulfill their need/desire for any kind of relationship with all inclusive questions and matching regardless of gender or sexuality and solely a user’s personal preference. I have also noticed that there are some (unintentional) stigmas attached to many dating apps that were not straight forward enough. It is my goal to have an app where there will be no room for stereotypes and stigmas but inclusivity and mutual understandings of user intentions.</p>

<p>My audience will be those seeking to establish a connection with other users and potentially develop a relationship. It will include people of ages 18 and up. All genders and sexual orientations are welcome.</p>
